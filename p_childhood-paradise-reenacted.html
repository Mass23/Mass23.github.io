            <p style="font-family: 'Andale Mono', monospace; text-align: justify;">
                Childhood Paradise Reenacted is a photographic study of how Swiss adults navigate the layered relationship between personal history and national landscapes. 
                The project examines the trajectory of engagement with nature—initially structured by family traditions, later rejected in favor of urban independence, and ultimately reclaimed as an autonomous choice.<br>
                <br>
                Hiking, a deeply embedded cultural practice in Switzerland, is often experienced as an obligation in childhood, an imposed rhythm of family weekends. In young adulthood, it is frequently discarded—a resistance to inherited customs and a shift toward metropolitan spaces. 
                However, in later years, many return to these landscapes, not through nostalgia, but by actively redefining their connection to the land as a personal and cultural anchor. 
                This process accelerated particularly during the COVID pandemic years, when outdoor environments became more attractive compared to enclosed urban spaces.<br>
                <br>
                By photographing these spaces through the lens of those who left and returned, the project interrogates notions of territorial memory, the cyclical nature of cultural participation, and the way landscapes are not just external environments but evolving interfaces between the individual and the collective. 
                Switzerland’s topography is more than a backdrop; it is a system that continuously absorbs and reconfigures human movement, identity, and perception.<br>
